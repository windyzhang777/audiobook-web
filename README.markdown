## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install all dependencies:

npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run dev:client  # Client on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:server  # Server on http://localhost:3001
```

### Building

Build all packages:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build individually:

```bash
npm run build:shared
npm run build:server
npm run build:client
```

### Code Quality

```bash
